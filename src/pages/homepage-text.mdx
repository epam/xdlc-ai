>< xldc.ai ./> is a collective of software development professionals (engineers, testers, analysts, managers, designers, etc.) who are passionate about the future of software engineering and the role of AI in it. We believe that the future of software engineering is in the hands of the people, and we are here to help you make it happen.

This projects shares the evidence, insights and recomendations that will help you benefit Gen AI the most when applied to software development.

Our experience comes from real production experience, workiong on small and large code bases - real life use of AI is different from tutorial like coding in ChatGPT as demonstrated across the interenet. We also aknolwdge that creating great software is not just coding. Well written story is no less important than a well writen code. Other roles, beyond software engineers, can benefit: software testers, requirements analysts, product owners, project managers, etc.

We believe that many of the challenges, while rooted in LLM and Gen AI nature, can be overcome if you learn the right ways of use and make informed decisions about certain tools and products.
