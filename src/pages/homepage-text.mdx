Software Engineering is arguably **the insdustry** that has benefitted from Generative AI the most. GitHub Copilot, the pioneer of AI Coding Assistants, has brought an enourmous ammount of products - one can find almost [50](https://alternativeto.net/software/github-copilot/) alternatives to it.

[2024 Stackoverflow Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/ai#sentiment-and-usage-ai-select) suggests that ðŸ˜Š  62% of developers use AI tools and 72% favour their use. Yet, ðŸ˜ž 2 out of 3 developers have brought up multiple challenges stopping them from leveraging the tools (such as lack of trust or AI missing wider context).

>< xldc.ai /> is a collective of software development professionals (engineers, testers, analysts, managers, designers, etc.) who are passionate about the future of software engineering and the role of AI in it.

This project shares the evidence, insights and recomendations that will help you benefit Gen AI the most when applied to software development.

Our experience comes from real production projects, working on small and large code bases - real life use of AI is different from tutorial-like single-file coding in ChatGPT as demonstrated across the interenet. We also aknolwdge that creating great software is not just coding. Well written story is no less important than a well writen code. Other roles, beyond software engineers, can benefit: software testers, requirements analysts, product owners, project managers, etc.

We believe that many of the challenges, while rooted in LLM and Gen AI nature, can be overcome if you learn the right way of use and make informed decisions about certain tools and products.
